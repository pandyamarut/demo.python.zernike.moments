# demo.python.zernike.moments
Testing Zernike moments a powerfull shape descriptor, based on Zernike polynomials

Image processing and computer vision techniques such as:
* Edge detection
* Thresholding
* Perspective warping

We can abstractly represent the image using only a list of numbers (image feature vector).

Python Libraries You Will Need:
* Requests
* BeautifulSoup (bs4 web scraping)
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Scikit-Image
* OpenCV (with bindings)

The steps:
1. Download sprites (a dataset of images)
2. Quantify sprites in terms of their outline (shape)
2. Process the numeric data
3. Train and evaluate learners
4. Plot and compare results
